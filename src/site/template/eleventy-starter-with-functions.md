This project template includes a simple home page and build pipeline using [Eleventy](https://11ty.io), [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) and Netlify's serverless function helper: [Netlify Lambda](https://www.npmjs.com/package/netlify-lambda).

It has a simple asset pipeline build with Gulp to prepare JavaScript, Image assets, and compile Sass into CSS.
